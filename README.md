# jiggety
Workstation config scripts for openSUSE that make you feel home again and happy. Jiggety jig.

## Jiggety expects
- a fresh install of openSUSE Tumbleweed (or _maybe_ LinuxMint)
- a working internet connection
- you have already installed git

## To use: 
- Clone or otherwise download this repository
- Navigate into the repository on your local machine
- Check out branch openSUSE (or LinuxMint for Mint installs)
- Review and personalize the code - know what you're doing before you push the red button
- `bash jiggety`

## To Contribute: 
- Open an issue describing the feature you would like to add.
  These are my personal config scripts, and features I am not interested in should remain in your fork.
- Major features should be added as independent bash scripts,
  with the option to run/not run exposed in the main runner script `jiggety`
- Minor features may be added to relevant existing scripts,
  or in their own scripts if the content is not thematically aligned

CAUTION: Use only at your own risk.
Jiggety is a work in progress, provided "as is", without warranty of fitness for any purpose.
