# jiggety
Workstation config scripts for openSUSE that make you feel home again and happy. Jiggety jig.


## Jiggety expects
- a fresh install of openSUSE Leap
- a working internet connection
- you have already installed git

## To use: 
- Clone or otherwise download this repository
- Check out openSUSE (or master for LinuxMint installs)
- Navigate into the repository on your local machine
- Review and personalize the code - ensure you know what you're doing before you push the red button
- `bash jiggety`

## To Contribute: 
- Open an issue describing the feature you would like to add. These are my personal config scripts, and features I am not intersted in may be better left in your fork. 
- Major features should be added as independent bash scripts, with the option to run/not run exposed in the main script `jiggety`
- Minor features may be added to relevant existing scripts, or in their own scripts if the content is not thematically aligned
- Contributions that improve on Cinnamon Desktop defaults are especially welcome.

CAUTION: Use only at your own risk. Jiggety is a work in progress, provided "as is", without warranty of fitness for any purpose.
