# jiggety
workstation config scripts for linuxMint and (sortof) openSUSE

## Jiggety expects
- a fresh install of LinuxMint or openSUSE Tumbleweed
- a working internet connection
- you have already installed git

- if you are using LinuxMint, you have configured Timeshift snapshots to use RSYNC

## To use: 
- Clone or otherwise download this repository
- Navigate into the repository on your local machine
- Review the code - ensure you know what you're doing before you push the red button
- `bash jiggety`

CAUTION: Use only at your own risk. Jiggety is a work in progress, provided "as is", without warranty of fitness for any purpose.
